# Koko's Personal Website Project

Welcome to my personal website project! This README file provides instructions for new users to clone and run the project on their local machine.

You may also choose to view the deployed website here: https://morenokoko.github.io

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) installed on your system.
- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox) for viewing the application.

## Getting Started

To clone and run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```git clone https://github.com/Morenokoko/morenokoko.github.io.git```

    or

    ```git clone git@github.com:Morenokoko/morenokoko.github.io.git```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```cd your-project```

3. Install the project dependencies using Yarn:

    ```yarn install```

## Running the Application

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server and view the application in your browser:

```yarn start```

This command will start the development server, and you can access the application by opening your browser and navigating to http://localhost:3000.

## Building the Application

To build the application for production, you can use the following command:

```yarn build```

This command creates an optimized production build of the application in the build directory.
